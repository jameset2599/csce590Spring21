They said they won’t be able to carry out the sale of medicine for long without assurance of medical care.Office bearers of the Lucknow Chemist Association (LCA), a body of wholesale and retail chemists in the city, demanded that the district administration ensure beds were available for medicine traders if they got infected with Covid-19 and needed hospitalisation. The association said traders were getting infected and deaths were being reported from among them and their family members. Harish Shah, president of LCA, wrote a letter to the district magistrate on the issue. A spokesperson Mayank Rastogi said medicine traders were at risk but they were not considered corona warriors. “Almost every day, news about death from among the traders or their family members is coming.
